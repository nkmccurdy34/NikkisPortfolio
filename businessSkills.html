    <h3 id="internship">Client Reporting</h3>
      <p>I dealt with creating monthly and quarterly business reports often in my internship. I learned valuable skills by creating and reviewing client reports for a financial institution. While checking these reports, I learned definitions of financial terms and how to navigate the company's large database. I used programs like Coric document warehouse to send reports through a review stage. I also used SimCorp STR Layout Builder, STR Production Control, and STR Data Mapper to build reports and see where data was coming from. It was important for me to understand what each data point meant to be able to check if there were errors in the reports. I also worked closely with my team, asking questions when I did not know where a data point was coming from and helping others with their questions when I solved a similar issue.</p>
      <p>The other part of my experience was working with SQL and creating Stored Procedures. I have outlined this more in my <a class="linkcolor" href="programSkills.html#SQL">SQL section </a> on my Programming Skills page. </p>

      <h3 id="Knacktive">Knacktive</h3>
        <p>"Knacktive is an advanced, undergraduate, course/agency experience at Northwest Missouri State University.  The elective course is designed to replicate the creative demands and intense teamwork atmosphere of a technology-oriented, professional marketing communications agency." I participated in Knacktive as a copywriter on the eight-person Cultivators team in the Spring of 2018. We worked closely as we created a pitch for the nonprofit <a href= "http://www.americanroyal.com/">American Royal</a>. I learned valuable skills while working with my team. These skills included how to communicate effectively, great time management skills, and how to problem solve quickly. I created mock-ups for pamphlets and worked closely with each person to complete a 48-page pitchbook. I learned the value of hard work and relying on other people to complete tasks. We worked together as a team well and completed a great presentation to the client at the end of the semester. </p>

    <h3 id="Other">Other: IT Project Management Business Rebuild</h3>
      <p> I took a class called IT Project Management in the Spring of 2019. We had a semester-long group project where we remodeled a fictional business in Maryville, MO. My group decided to change the restaurant from a bar and grill to an affordable surf and turf place with a bar for college students; we changed the theme of the restaurant because the local area is overpopulated with bar and grill places, so changing to a surf and turf bar would help our plan stand out from the crowd. Then, we obtained estimates for a physical remodel of the interior, including new carpeting and the creation of a bar. Scheduling of the project was a challenge, but it was easier to visualize using Microsoft Project. We also made a budget for our remodel and estimated where the break-even point for the project was. Little items, like alcohol licensing and extra insurance, could not be overlooked. I helped create a mock-up of a restaurant website using Wix.com. Finally, my team gave a 20-minute pitch of our restaurant remodel ideas and won the class competition for best presentation. </p>
